# Password Verification with Serial Monitor using Arduino Uno in Proteus
This experiment demonstrates how to implement a password check functionality using an Arduino board and simulate it in Proteus using the Serial Monitor (Virtual Terminal) component. The experiment showcases the process of inputting a password through the Virtual Terminal and verifying it against a predefined password in the Arduino code.

When the predefined password is written in serial monitor, it will print "Thank you for logging in". Otherwise, it will print "No access".

# How to run this?
Now, first clone the repository. Then, inside the `Experiment` folder, open the `Experiment.ino` file in the Arduino IDE. If the `Arduino IDE` is opening for the first time on your operating system, after opening the Experiment.ino file, go to `File` > `Preferences` > tick the `Compile` option beside `Show verbose output during`. Then, click `OK`. (No need to repeat this task from the second time onwards.)

Now, click the `Verify` button located in the upper left corner, and from the output, copy the following path: `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp\arduino\sketches\XXXXXXXXXX/Experiment.ino.elf`.

Next, open the `Experiment.pdsprj` file in Proteus. Double-click on `Arduino Uno` and paste the `...ino.elf` link into the `Program File` field. Then, click `OK`.

Boom! Everything is set up properly. Now, just click the `Run` button located in the bottom left corner and simulate the experiment.

# Note
After running the simulation, a `Virtual Monitor` will pop up. Click on it and type the password. There is no need to press the `Enter` button on the keyboard after typing the password. If you type the wrong password, it will display `No access`, and if you type the correct password, it will show `Thank you for logging in`. Remember, if the `Echo Typed Characters` option is turned off, what you type on the Virtual Monitor will not be shown on the display. So, don't panic, just type.
